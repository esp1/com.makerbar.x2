POV Globe API
=============

The first byte is 0xFF, the delineator, to tell packets apart. This number is unique - no opcode or parameter will ever be 0xFF.
The second byte is the opcode. Each command has a distinct opcode.
If commands require other parameters, they will be sent as additional bytes.

After each command is processed, the globe should send back 0xFF as acknowledgement.

// Reticle

0x10: ClearReticle() - removes the reticle.

0x11: SetReticle(x, y) - puts the reticle (crosshairs or indicator dot) on the given coords relative to globe origin.
